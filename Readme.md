#Baron Blog Engine Gem

This is my first project in Ruby. I wanted to create the simpliest blog engine I
could that included all the features I was looking for in my person blog. 
There are two parts, the [Baron Blog Engine Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/baron] 
and the [Baron Blog](https://github.com/nbuggia/baron-blog) project. The gem 
contains the code for routing, HTTP, and the MVC components of a simple blog. 
The blog project instantiates the gem and includes the blog UI templates and 
content.

While writing this blog engine, I barrowed some code and design approches
from many existing blog engines. Following were the most useful.
