# Redirect Config File
#
# Use this file to list all of the redirections you'd like the blog to process
# using the same file-format as Apache.
#
# File Format: 
#
# Each line is a separate redirect. Below is a description of each field:
#
# Field #1 - Redirect. Doesn't really do anything but make the file easier to read
# Field #2 - Status Code. 301 status codes are for permanent redirections. Google
#			 transfer full PageRank for these to the destination page (unless it
#			 is on another domain, that gets a little more complex). 302 status 
#			 codes are for temperary redirects, those are anything less than a 
#			 couple of days. 302 redirects are not really used that often in a blog.

# Field #3 - Source Path. This is the path (e.g. no protocol or domain name) that 
#			 you would like to redirect somewhere else.
# Field #4 - Desitnation Path. This is the location you would like to redirect the
#			 user to. It does not have to be on your domain
#
# Sample redirects:
#
# Redirect 301 /posts/my-first-article /2013/01/01/my-first-article
# Redirect 302 / /temp-custom-home-page
# Redirect 301 /pub/download/file?name=myarchive.zip /downloads/myarchive.zip
# Redirect 301 /my-project https://github/my-project-home
